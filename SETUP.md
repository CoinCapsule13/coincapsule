## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

- **Node.js** (v16.x or later)
- **npm** (v8.x or later)
- **MetaMask** or another Ethereum wallet for interacting with the contract
- **Ganache** (optional, for local development)
- **A supported Ethereum network** (Mainnet, Testnet, or custom network like Arbitrum)

## 1. Clone the Repository

    Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coin-capsule.git
cd coin-capsule
```
 ##   2. Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies for both the frontend and backend:
```js
npm install
```
This will install all necessary packages, including smart contract tools, Web3.js, and other dependencies.

## 3. Configure Network (MetaMask)
   If you plan to deploy and interact with CoinCapsule on a test network or the Ethereum mainnet, make sure to:

Open MetaMask and select the appropriate network (Mainnet, Rinkeby, or Arbitrum).
    Ensure your wallet has ETH (or test tokens for test networks) to interact with the contract.
## 4. Deploy the Smart Contract (Optional for Developers)
   If you want to deploy the contract to your chosen network, follow these steps:

## 4.1. Configure Deployment Scripts
In the scripts directory, you'll find deployment scripts configured for different networks. Modify the configuration based on your desired network:

Set the correct network ID (e.g., 1 for Ethereum Mainnet, 42161 for Arbitrum).
Ensure your wallet private key is properly set in the .env file.
## 4.2. Deploy the Contract
Deploy the smart contract using Hardhat or Truffle:
```js
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network_name>
```
Replace <network_name> with your target network (e.g., rinkeby, mainnet, or a custom configuration).

## 5. Interact with the Smart Contract
Once deployed, you can interact with CoinCapsule through the provided frontend, or directly through a script or using Web3.js or ethers.js.

## _To start the frontend:_
```js
npm start
```
This will launch a local server where you can interact with the CoinCapsule wallet.

## 6. Troubleshooting
If you run into any issues during the setup process, here are a few common steps to resolve them:

Make sure you're connected to the correct network in MetaMask.

Double-check that your .env file has the correct private keys and environment 
configurations.

Ensure that all dependencies are installed (npm install).

## _Additional Information_
